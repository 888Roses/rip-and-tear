# What is Rip and Tear?
Rip and Tear is a Minecraft mod that draws inspiration from one and only [Charter Mod by Arathain](https://github.com/Arathain/charter) to add powerful dark magic to the game. Make unsettling discoveries, deals with powerful beings, and receive power beyond your wildest dreams.
*Fortune favours the bold.*

# Why "Rip And Tear"?
Rip and Tear is a line the Slayer says in the Doom series, and also a line that [R4T](https://www.youtube.com/@doctor4t) kept repeating in [Winsweep](https://www.youtube.com/@WinSweep)'s latest event. It gave me the idea to create this mod, and I thought it was fitting for a ~~mass destruction~~ dark magic minecraft mod.
